## Original request / feature

Create a comprehensive, minimalist-but-premium redesign plan for the portfolio blog, covering visual system, layout rhythm, motion, project presentation, blog reading, nav/footer, theming/a11y, and finishing touches.

## Challenges

- Avoiding “template” look while staying minimalist.
- Ensuring parity across light/dark and reduced-motion users.
- Keeping performance budgets while adding polish.

## Successes

- Produced an 8-step actionable plan grounded in design tokens and UI specs.
- Identified quick wins with high perceived quality lift (skip link, progress bar, ToC, 404).

## Methods that did/didn’t work

- Worked: token-first system (OkLCH), consistent spacing/type scale, motion guidelines, evidence-driven case studies.
- Didn’t: heavy animations, multiple accents, shadow-heavy elevation, icon variety.

## Changes made to the codebase

- Authored `blog-revamp.md` with the complete plan.
